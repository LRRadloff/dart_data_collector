# dart_data_collector

This repository contains the code for a small R Shiny App I created, available at 

https://lradloff.shinyapps.io/dart_data_collector/

It simplifies the process of collecting data on your dart throws and, hence, assessing your throws precision. 
The latter is a necessary input for the [dart_optimizer](https://github.com/LRRadloff/dart_optimizer/), another Shiny app I created. It further performs statistical
hypothesis tests evaluating the assumptions made in the [dart_optimizer](https://github.com/LRRadloff/dart_optimizer/).
